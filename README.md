# Projects
Personal projects that interest me. Most of them are finance related.

1. Regression analysis for CAPM model in R.
2. Analysis of pairs-trading in the crypto market in Python.
3. Using different Monte Carlo methods (Plain MC, Anthithetic MC & Control Variate MC) to price Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits (GMWB) products for both discrete and continuous withdrawals. In addition, the fair value of the insurance charge for the GMWB product can be determined using a root solver algorithm.
4. VIX Prediction using RNN, LSTM and SARIMAX models where lagged SP500 volume and returns are used as exogenous data.
5. Using Term SOFRs, the short end of the yield curve is constructed. This consists of maturities ranging from 1 month to 1 year. Linear interpolation on the yields were used for construction through bootstrapping.
6. Using finite difference methods (Implicit, Explicit, CN Schemes), the Fokker-Planck equation, which is used to model the evolution of the density given a starting density, is used to model an asset that has a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) Ito diffusion.
